# Blood_presuure_abnormality

# Introduction
**We have a data which we have state the patient have blood pressure issue or not according to features <br>
**here we use classification algorithms <br>
1. Logistic Regression
2.DecisionTreeClassifier
3.Random Forest Classifier
4.Support Vector Machine

# **Conclusion:-**

*    After compairing all the parameters the Decision Tree is the best model among other algorithms.
## 9. Pickling the Model file for Deployement
After That model deployed on AWS Cloud
file are attached in description:
1.template(index.html) --> this file contain html page for design
2.staticfiles(style.css) --> this file is css file which contain background,font,style,etc for html page
3.app.py --> link file
4.blood_pressure.ipynb--> creating model
